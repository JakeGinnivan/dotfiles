# ~/.zshenv - Runs for ALL shells (interactive and non-interactive)
# Keep this minimal - only PATH and critical environment variables
# This ensures tools like VSCode can find node, npm, etc. when restored by macOS

# Add local binaries
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

# Homebrew (critical for finding node, npm, and all brew-installed tools)
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
